## Sasss
I will be using sass for styling so to work with that you have to have node installed
```shell
npm -v
node -v
```
if none of those worsks, you don't have node installed. Simply google and install that.
Then inside the project terminal, run the above commands again. If they now work and show a version. You can install the dependencies in "Package.json"
```shell
npm i
```

when you want to compile sass; run
```shell
npm run build:sass
```
